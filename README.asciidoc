= Spring Boot Example

== Maven commands

Use

`./mvnw dependency:tree`

to get an overview over all dependencies.

== Start / deliver the application

=== Maven

To run the application, just type

`./mvnw spring-boot:run`

This works since spring-boot-starter-parent is the parent of our pom.

=== Create an executable .jar

`./mvnw package`

This works since spring-boot-maven-plugin is configured as Maven plugin (spring-boot-loader creates an executable .jar).

Execute the .jar:

`java -jar target/spring-boot-example.jar`

== Call a service

`curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/hello?title=World`
